#Sensors Team Plan - Next Few Weeks (as of 10/30/25)

---

##Plan 
The Sensors Team's goal for the next couple  weeks is to **research, define, and prepare implenentation plans** for the system's
input camera. Aim to understand the full scope of technical and integration needs before the hardware is selected.

## Questions to Be Answered
1. **Camera Type**
	- What kind of camera fits the system requirements (USB, I^2C, SPI, etc.)?
2. **Specifications**
	- What are the **mininum** and **maximum** specs needed (resolution, frame rate, latency, field of view)?
3. **Power Requirements**
   	- How much power will the camera draw, and how does that affect the power design?
4. **Hardware Integration**
   	- What type of hardware or board will the camera connect to?
5. **Data**
   	- What kind of data will the camera produce, and in what format?
   	- How do we want to structure that data for the **Software/Data Structures team**?
6. **Real-Time Detection**
   	- How can we implement **real-time image detection** efficiently?
7. **API and Communication**
   	- How will we expose the camera data to other teams via an **API**?
   	- What is the expected data flow between sensors-> contro-> software?

##Next Steps

The next steps for the Sensors Team over the next couple  weeks include:

- Research different camera types while keeping cost in mind
- Gather and compare camera specs
- Begin learning the basics of **Python for interface testing** and learn how **APIs** are implemented and or created.
- Continue to communicate with the **Requirements Team** to ensure all base requirements are met.


## Notes

- Much of this research and design work depends on input from the **Requirements** and **Software** teams.  
- Therefore not much implementation can be done at the moment. However, this is a great time to research tools that will be needed for the success of this project
