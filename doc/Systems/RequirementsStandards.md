**Team Expectations**

- The team will communicate through a Discord group chat.   
- We expect members to participate in each of the twice weekly meetings on Wednesday and Thursday. Subteam meetings beyond regular club meetings will be scheduled only if needed.  
- We will have a continually updated google doc containing meeting notes updated by documentation members, and if someone misses a meeting they will be able to catch up by reading the latest notes and asking for help from other members. Ideally, members will let the team know in advance if they have to miss a meeting.  
- Possible changes to the plan shall be reviewed by and communicated to all subteam members in advance.  
- If you are sick, unwell, or have other issues, just communicate with the team that you wonâ€™t be available..
