# Firmware / Platform Team Member Roles:

- **Communications Focal**: Sloan
- **Participation Focal**: Dara, Phoebe
- **Documentation Focal**: Elias, Somya
- **Product Focal**: Alexa, Rithvik
- **Engagement Focal**: Alex

**Communication systems**: The firmware team has created a group chat on iMessage for communication amongst members, as well as a Google Document to keep track of notes for meetings and firmware work progress. 
**If a team member can't show up to a club meeting**: They can keep up with the content outlined in the team's Google document. Also check Discord consistently (highly recommended) for more information.
**Amount of time expected to commit towards this team/club**: Currently, we are expecting to only work within the Wednesday & Thursday 7pm-8pm club meetings, but working additional hours outside of meeting times is optional. Team members are more than welcome to do independent research and relay their findings to the team through the firmware/platform team's Google Document.

The above policy is subject to change as Firmware/Platform team members progress through the project.
