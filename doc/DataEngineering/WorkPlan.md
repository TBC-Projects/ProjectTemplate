# Working Plan

## Communication Method
* Discord Group Chat

## Meeting outside of club time
Will meet outside of club time if we have to at Odegaard or some other place.

## If someone misses a meeting
Catch them up with meeting notes made by the documentation focal.

## Participation expectations
Members should show up to every meeting that they're able to, if they can't make a meeting then they should notify the others and catch up at home.

## To change the working plan
Talk to the subteam lead Adelyn.
