# Project Title  

## Introduction
This document is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of our project's developments and serve as a reference tool for new members joining our team.

This report serves two primary functions:

1. **Project Review:** The document provides details on our established objectives, achievements, encountered challenges, key learnings, and prospective future plans. This reflective evaluation allows our team to track progress, make necessary adjustments, and maintain a clear vision moving forward.  
2. **New Member Orientation:** The report also serves as a detailed onboarding guide designed to assist new members in understanding the project's context, objectives, and intricacies. We intend this guide to expedite the acclimatization process and equip newcomers with the necessary knowledge to contribute effectively in the forthcoming semester.
